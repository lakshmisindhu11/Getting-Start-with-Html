    <h1>Tags</h1>
    <p>A tag is a piece of markup language used to indicate the start and end of 
        an element in an HTML document. It is surrounded by angle brackets ("&lt;" and ">").
         Tags usually come in pairs, with the opening tag preceding the content and 
         the closing tag following the content.</p>
    <h1>Element</h1>
    <p>An element, on the other hand, is the entire entity that consists of the start tag,
         the content, and the end tag. It represents a single unit of structure or 
         semantics in an HTML document.</p>
